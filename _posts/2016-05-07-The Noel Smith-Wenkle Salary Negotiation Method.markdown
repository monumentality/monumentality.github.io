Salary negotiation is something at which hiring managers are usually a lot more proficient than the people they hire. In the interest of leveling the playing field, here is a method for salary negotiation that has worked for me and many others.

Noel Smith-Wenkle is a headhunter, and he taught me this method in about 1982. Headhunters' fees are proportional to the salary that their clients get, so it is in their interest to get as much as possible.

Disclaimer: This method was tuned for the hiring climate for sought-after software developers in Silicon Valley in the early 80s, so it may not work for any given situation. However, I think the principles have general applicability. Your mileage may vary.

Fundamentals

Salaries depend mainly on two things: the work and the geographical area. Most companies share salary data with each other: the typical big-company personnel department will have detailed breakdowns on the distribution of salaries for their types of work and locales. So they will generally know within a pretty narrow range what your job is worth.

To save labor costs, almost all companies play a nasty little game. They ask you how much you want. Sometimes there's a slot on your application named something innocent like "desired salary range." Most people automatically fill in all blanks on a form, so they'll put down a figure.

Unfortunately, many people underestimate their worth, so they'll put down a low figure, less than the company was prepared to pay. It's a rare company who will offer you what you're worth in this situation. Some companies will even bargain down your already undervalued amount.

You're happy because you got what you asked for (or nearly so), and they're happy because they're underpaying you and you're not likely to realize it.

So, the bottom line is: Don't tell them how much you'll take.

Before you begin negotiating, you must have a minimum salary figure in mind. If at all possible, you should talk to several people who are doing similar work in an area with similar living costs. Watch out! People from rural New Mexico, for example, have no idea how ungodly expensive it is to live in the Bay Area or Boston.

Remember the bottom line, though: have a minimum figure in your head, but don't tell them.

The purpose of the method is to get the company to be the first party to name a number. If it's above your minimum, you accept. If it's too low, you tell them it's too low, but you do not say by how much. They will either break off negotiations or come back with a higher offer. Your only responses are either "okay" or "higher", never "X amount higher."

The method in action

If they try to get you to name a figure on the application, leave it blank. You want them to ask for a number verbally.

Step 1. The first time they ask you how much you'll take, reply:

I am much more interested in doing (type of work) here at (name of company) than I am in the size of the initial offer.

This sentence is constructed with great care. You may want to memorize it. It does several things for you. It's great public relations. The vast majority of people answer their question with a number. Because you have focused on the job and not on the compensation, you have instantly distinguished yourself from the thundering herd. You have also dodged their question.
Noel said that about 40% of the time this is all you need, and the hiring manager will go off and look up your numbers and make you a fair offer. However, over half the time, they will ask you again.

Step 2. The second time they ask, reply:

I will consider any reasonable offer.
 
This is basically a stalling tactic. The word 'consider' has a lot of leeway in it. Add to this the large amount of slop in the word 'reasonable', and obviously the sentence has no meaning at all. But you've been polite, and once more you've refused to name the first figure.
Noel said that in only about 30% of the cases was it necessary to go to step 3.

Step 3.

You are in a much better position to know how much I'm worth to you than I am.

Once again, you have been polite, and again you have refused to name a number. You have also told them, in so many words, that you are onto their little game. If they ask a fourth or even a fifth time how much you'll take (Noel said it rarely happens), repeat step 3.

我读过的最好的如何谈薪水的文章，不过实际应用还有一些因素要考虑：

1. 使用这样的策略将会塑造你的个人形象：公司会认为应聘者是一个主动进取，敢于冒险的人。如果你对这样的个人形象感到不适，不要尝试

2. 如果是独立的人力资源来面试你，不必过分担心自己的个人形象；如果是未来的上司来谈薪水，要注意保持个人形象的统一性

3. 某些企业文化不喜欢有冒险精神，独立思考，有进取心的员工，不要采取这种策略。比如华为？某些创业公司非常看重进取精神，应当果断使用

4. 观察猜测HR的性格：有些人不能接受应聘者占据主动权，有些人是感性型大过理性型。面对这两种人需要采用完全相反的策略

核心原则是：尽最大努力让对方先说一个数字，这表示公司更需要你，而不是你更需要这份工作。这将会后续具体谈判打下一个坚固的基础
