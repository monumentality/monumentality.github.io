<h1 id="psychologically-i-find-that-the-major-objection-is-that-people-think-great-science-is-done-by-lucka-idsec-1-namesec-1a">psychologically. I find that the major objection is that people think great science is done by luck.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h1>

<p>Well, consider Einstein. Note how many different things he did that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn’t it a little too repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn’t do just information theory. Several years before, he did some other good things and some which are still locked up in the security of cryptography. He did many good things.
You see again and again, that it is more than one thing from a good person. Once in a while a person does only one thing in his whole life, and we’ll talk about that later, but a lot of times there is repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything.</p>

<h1 id="one-of-the-characteristics-of-successful-scientists-is-having-couragea-idsec-2-namesec-2a">One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage.<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h1>

<p>Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can’t, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to think of his major theorem. He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn’t know what to do so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the impossible question, ``What would the average random code do?’’ He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code. Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.</p>

<h1 id="what-most-people-think-are-the-best-working-conditions-are-not-very-clearly-they-are-not-because-people-are-often-most-productive-when-working-conditions-are-bada-idsec-3-namesec-3a">What most people think are the best working conditions, are not. Very clearly they are not because people are often most productive when working conditions are bad.<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a></h1>

<p>think that if you look carefully you will see that often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset. For example, many scientists when they found they couldn’t do a problem finally began to study why not. They then turned it around the other way and said, ``But of course, this is what it is’’ and got an important result. So ideal working conditions are very strange. The ones you want aren’t always the best ones for you.</p>

<h1 id="now-for-the-matter-of-drivea-idsec-4-namesec-4a">Now for the matter of drive.<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a></h1>

<p>You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode’s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?’’ He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.’’ I simply slunk out of the office!</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-and-productivity-are-like-compound-interesta-idsec-4-1-namesec-4-1a">knowledge and productivity are like compound interest<a id="sec-4-1" name="sec-4-1"></a></h2>

<p>Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.</p>

<h2 id="on-this-matter-of-drive-edison-says-genius-is-99-perspiration-and-1-inspirationa-idsec-4-2-namesec-4-2a">On this matter of drive Edison says, ``Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.’‘<a id="sec-4-2" name="sec-4-2"></a></h2>

<p>I’ve often wondered why so many of my good friends at Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did, didn’t have so much to show for it. The misapplication of effort is a very serious matter. Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.</p>

<h1 id="great-contributions-are-rarely-done-by-adding-another-decimal-place-it-comes-down-to-an-emotional-commitmenta-idsec-5-namesec-5a">Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment.<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a></h1>

<p>Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don’t become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work.</p>

<h1 id="great-scientists-tolerate-ambiguity-very-wella-idsec-6-namesec-6a">Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well.<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a></h1>

<p>They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-do-not-work-on-an-important-problem-its-unlikely-youll-do-important-worka-idsec-7-namesec-7a">if you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a></h1>

<p>We didn’t work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It’s not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important.
When I say that most scientists don’t work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn’t believe that they will lead to important problems.</p>

<h1 id="you-cant-always-know-exactly-where-to-be-but-you-can-keep-active-in-places-where-something-might-happena-idsec-8-namesec-8a">You can’t always know exactly where to be, but you can keep active in places where something might happen<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a></h1>

<p>When I went to lunch Friday noon, I would only discuss great thoughts after that. By great thoughts I mean ones like: ``What will be the role of computers in all of AT&amp;T?’’, ``How will computers change science?’’</p>

<h1 id="the-essence-of-science-is-cumulativea-idsec-9-namesec-9a">The essence of science is cumulative.<a id="sec-9" name="sec-9"></a></h1>

<p>By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.</p>

<h1 id="it-is-not-sufficient-to-do-a-job-you-have-to-sell-ita-idsec-10-namesec-10a">it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it.<a id="sec-10" name="sec-10"></a></h1>

<p>`Selling’ to a scientist is an awkward thing to do. It’s very ugly; you shouldn’t have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you’ve done, read it, and come back and say, ``Yes, that was good.’’</p>

<h1 id="youve-got-to-work-on-important-problems-i-deny-that-it-is-all-luck-but-i-admit-there-is-a-fair-element-of-lucka-idsec-11-namesec-11a">You’ve got to work on important problems. I deny that it is all luck, but I admit there is a fair element of luck.<a id="sec-11" name="sec-11"></a></h1>

<p>I subscribe to Pasteur’s ``Luck favors the prepared mind.’’ I favor heavily what I did. Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time trying to understand the bigger problems in the field, i.e. what was and what was not important.
I found in the early days I had believed `this’ and yet had spent all week marching in `that’ direction. It was kind of foolish. If I really believe the action is over there, why do I march in this direction? I either had to change my goal or change what I did. So I changed something I did and I marched in the direction I thought was important. It’s that easy.</p>

<h1 id="is-the-effort-to-be-a-great-scientist-worth-ita-idsec-12-namesec-12a">is the effort to be a great scientist worth it?<a id="sec-12" name="sec-12"></a></h1>

<p>’ To answer this, you must ask people. When you get beyond their modesty, most people will say, ``Yes, doing really first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine, women and song put together,’’ or if it’s a woman she says, ``It is as good as wine, men and song put together.’’
I have never dared to go out and ask those who didn’t do great work how they felt about the matter. It’s a biased sample, but I still think it is worth the struggle. I think it is very definitely worth the struggle to try and do first-class work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle more than it is in the result. The struggle to make something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my opinion.</p>

<h1 id="ive-told-you-how-to-do-it-it-is-so-easy-so-why-do-so-many-people-with-all-their-talents-faila-idsec-13-namesec-13a">I’ve told you how to do it. It is so easy, so why do so many people, with all their talents, fail?<a id="sec-13" name="sec-13"></a></h1>

<h2 id="one-of-the-reasons-is-drive-and-commitmenta-idsec-13-1-namesec-13-1a">one of the reasons is drive and commitment.<a id="sec-13-1" name="sec-13-1"></a></h2>

<p>The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day. They don’t have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for really first-class work</p>

<h2 id="the-second-thing-is-i-think-the-problem-of-personality-defectsa-idsec-13-2-namesec-13-2a">The second thing is, I think, the problem of personality defects.<a id="sec-13-2" name="sec-13-2"></a></h2>

<p>If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support you.’’ And, he never went any further. He had his personality defect of wanting total control and was not willing to recognize that you need the support of the system.
good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a decision `No’, you just go to your boss and get a `No’ easy. If you want to do something, don’t ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don’t give him a chance to tell you `No’. But if you want a `No’, it’s easy to get a `No’.</p>

<h2 id="another-personality-defect-is-ego-assertiona-idsec-13-3-namesec-13-3a">Another personality defect is ego assertion<a id="sec-13-3" name="sec-13-3"></a></h2>

<p>You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-comes-down-to-basically-is-that-you-cannot-be-original-in-one-area-without-having-originality-in-othersa-idsec-13-4-namesec-13-4a">What it comes down to basically is that you cannot be original in one area without having originality in others.<a id="sec-13-4" name="sec-13-4"></a></h2>

<p>Originality is being different. You can’t be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics. But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets. I’m not against all ego assertion; I’m against some.</p>

<h2 id="another-fault-is-angera-idsec-13-5-namesec-13-5a">Another fault is anger.<a id="sec-13-5" name="sec-13-5"></a></h2>

<p>Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger is misdirected. You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the system all the time.</p>

<h2 id="another-thing-you-should-look-for-is-the-positive-side-of-things-instead-of-the-negativea-idsec-13-6-namesec-13-6a">Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative<a id="sec-13-6" name="sec-13-6"></a></h2>

<p>I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I’m surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.</p>

<h2 id="now-self-delusion-in-humans-is-very-very-commona-idsec-13-7-namesec-13-7a">Now self-delusion in humans is very, very common<a id="sec-13-7" name="sec-13-7"></a></h2>

<p>There are enumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding yourself and making it look some other way. When you ask, ``Why didn’t you do such and such,’’ the person has a thousand alibis. If you look at the history of science, usually these days there are 10 people right there ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first. The other nine fellows say, ``Well, I had the idea but I didn’t do it and so on and so on.’’ There are so many alibis. Why weren’t you first? Why didn’t you do it right? Don’t try an alibi. Don’t try and kid yourself. You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don’t mind. But to yourself try to be honest.</p>

<h1 id="in-summary-i-claim-that-some-of-the-reasons-why-so-many-people-who-have-greatness-within-their-grasp-dont-succeed-area-idsec-14-namesec-14a">in summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don’t succeed are:<a id="sec-14" name="sec-14"></a></h1>

<p>they don’t work on important problems, they don’t become emotionally involved, they don’t try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don’t. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I’ve told you how easy it is; furthermore I’ve told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!</p>
